This project presents a cloud-integrated plant incubator designed for controlled plant research and sustainable agriculture. Leveraging IoT and automation, the system regulates temperature, humidity, soil moisture, and lighting using DHT22 sensors, soil moisture probes, UV/LED grow lights, and a water pump. A live camera feed enables continuous visual monitoring. All environmental data is streamed to a cloud platform, enabling real-time access and remote control via mobile or web applications. This reduces manual effort, optimizes resource usage, and facilitates data-driven plant studies. The solution aligns with Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 9 by promoting innovation and smart agricultural practices.
